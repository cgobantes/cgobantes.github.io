<h1>Dear diary,</h1>

<h2>Today I thought my instinct was smarter than Google Maps, which almost led me to
one of the modern traveler's nightmares: not arriving to the airport on time
(and losing the flight back home). Needless to say, my instinct stinks and has
hardly ever been right.

That's how, instead of taking the F train and combining with the E to Jamaica
Station -where I could have taken the Air Train and arrive with plenty of time
to JFK-, I ended up in the middle of nowhere in Queens (actually, in 179
Street Station), waiting under the rain for a bus that took for hours! And it
didn't even take me to the right terminal... To add some spice,
I was too cheap to pay for roaming so I was relying on screenshots from the last
time I had access to free wifi.

"Stupid Google, I'm seeing that the F line also takes me to Jamaica 'Something'
Station. You're just too lazy to show me every posible combination". What I
didn't realize was that there is not only one Jamaica 'Something' Station. So
yes, as you probably already figured, Google Maps was right.

If you're wondering, I made it to the right terminal just on time. Luckily I'm
pretty nervous about all the unespected circumstances that could make me late
and with time I've come to accept my sillyness and bring it into the calculation
of how long it will take me to arrive to any airport. These time it took me
1,5 hours by train + 1 hour by bus (+ 30 minutes of uncertain wait in the
street) + 15 minutes by Air Train.

On my behalf, it was 5 dollars cheaper than Google's option. Not sure if the
stress and anecdote material were worth it.</h2>
